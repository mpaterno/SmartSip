<h1>Smart Sip</h2>

At SD Hacks 2018, we built a prototype water bottle that can communicate through bluetooth real time with an Android Phone App. SD Hacks was a 36 hour hackathon at UC San Diego.

We used an arduino integrated into the cap of a waterbottle to capture data from a temperature and ultrasonic sensor. That data was sent through a serial bluetooth connection read by an Android application that displayed that data feed real time. The data was also sent to the Google Firebase's cloud storage system.
